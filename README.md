# Excel Swiss Knife

**Excel Swiss Knife** is a free and open-source Excel add-in that adds hundreds of productivity tools missing from Excel.

It is designed for people who use Excel every day and want to work faster, cleaner, and with fewer errors — without writing VBA or complex formulas.

## Why Excel Swiss Knife exists

Excel is extremely powerful, but many common operations still require:
- repetitive manual steps
- fragile formulas
- temporary helper columns
- external tools
- custom VBA code

Excel Swiss Knife fills these gaps by providing ready-to-use tools directly inside Excel, available from a dedicated ribbon menu.

## What problems does it solve?

Excel Swiss Knife helps you with tasks such as:

- Cleaning and normalizing messy Excel data  
- Comparing ranges, sheets, or workbooks and finding differences  
- Batch renaming files and folders from Excel  
- Importing and exporting data in multiple formats  
- Transforming text, numbers, and formulas safely  
- Automating repetitive Excel operations with one click  
- Managing ranges, sheets, and workbooks more efficiently  

These are tasks that Excel *can* do — but usually in a slow, fragile, or overly complex way.

## How it works

- Installs as a standard Excel add-in  
- Adds a dedicated **Swiss Knife** ribbon tab  
- Each tool is independent and focused on a specific task  
- No external dependencies  
- No macros required from the user side  

You use it when you need it, without changing how you normally work in Excel.
